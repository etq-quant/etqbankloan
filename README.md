Key sectors driving the credit market:
1) Credit Cards (YoY growth - application: 42.28%, approval: 118.37%)
2) Passenger Cars (YoY growth - application: 215.59%, approval: 225.13%)

YoY growth of loan application and approval are very high, partially due to low base effect, but we are seeing all-time high in loan approval for Passenger Cars (RM 6.45B) and Residential Mortgages (RM13.8B vs 2013 high of RM12.5B) .
Loan approval for Credit Cards and Working Capital are still recovering at a strong pace.
